FT001,,Phishing for Information,"Adversaries may send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Phishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Phishing for information is different from Phishing in that the objective is gathering data from the victim rather than executing malicious code.

All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass credential harvesting campaigns.

Adversaries may also try to obtain information directly through the exchange of emails, instant messages, or other electronic conversation means. Victims may also receive phishing messages that direct them to call a phone number where the adversary attempts to collect confidential information.

Phishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information

Phishing for information may also involve evasive techniques, such as removing or manipulating emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send messages",,1/30/24,1/30/24,ft3,V.1,Reconnaissance,"Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.

FT003,,Seaching Credential Dumps,"Attackers often search for compromised data dumps, which are large collections of stolen credentials leaked from previous breaches or hacking incidents. When targeting platforms, fraudsters look for relevant login credentials or associated emails and passwords that might provide access to accounts or aid in bypassing two-factor authentication.

Execution: 

Attackers obtain credential dumps from dark web marketplaces, hacking forums, or through their own network breaches. Using automated tools, they sift through these dumps to find username and password pairs. They might also search for email addresses and associated passwords to target users with enabled two-factor authentication, hoping those individuals reuse passwords across multiple services.

Examples:

Finding a list of email and password pairs in a data breach dump, then using those credentials to attempt logins into accounts.
Utilizing stolen email access to intercept two-factor authentication codes or password reset emails.
Compiling lists of account credentials from various sources and trying them en masse, exploiting users' tendencies to reuse passwords across different platforms.

Goals: The primary aims of searching credential dumps for fraudulent purposes include:

Unauthorized access to accounts for fraudulent transactions, financial theft, or gathering sensitive customer and business data.
Overcoming two-factor authentication by obtaining access to the email accounts tied to accounts.
Creating a foundation for more sophisticated attacks, such as business email compromise (BEC), using trusted communication channels gained from compromised accounts or emails.

To compromise these accounts, fraudsters might use phishing attacks targeting the account owners, employ credential stuffing with previously leaked login details, exploit platform-specific vulnerabilities, or take over the accounts through social engineering techniques aimed at the platform's customer support.

Fraudulent Resource Procurement Use Case: 

Additionally, attackers might use illicitly obtained financial resources to buy access to already compromised accounts, especially those with a significant follower base or verified status. These purchased accounts are then used as a launchpad for financial fraud schemes, to sell fake ""influence"" services, or to promote scams under the guise of a trusted identity.

Examples:

Phishing messages via social media DMs (Direct Messages) or emails linked to fraudulent login pages designed to harvest social media account credentials.
Automated bots running credential stuffing attacks across various social media platforms to exploit reused passwords.
Manipulating social media platform recovery processes to gain unauthorized control over an account.
Buying and selling access to hacked social media accounts on the dark web to conduct fraudulent activities.

FT010.004,,Establish Accounts: Telegram Accounts,"Under the 'Resource Development' tactic, establishing Telegram accounts refers to the strategic creation of accounts on the Telegram platform, an encrypted messaging app, to facilitate communication, coordination, and potentially malicious activity. This tactic can be utilized by threat actors to build a network that supports various stages of a cyber operation, from initial reconnaissance to the execution of phishing campaigns, spreading malware, or coordinating fraudulent activities.

Execution: 
Cybercriminals create Telegram accounts—which may appear legitimate—potentially leveraging them for both covert communications and the distribution of malicious content or instructions among group members. These accounts can be used to organize and manage a network of collaborators, to distribute phishing links or malware, and to plan and execute social engineering attacks. The secure nature of Telegram makes it appealing for obfuscating malicious activities from law enforcement and cybersecurity teams.

Examples:

A threat actor establishes multiple Telegram accounts to be used for communicating details of a planned attack against a financial institution.
Telegram accounts are created to act as command and control channels for botnet operators, allowing them to issue commands to infected devices while avoiding detection.

The compromised credentials are then exploited to hijack merchant accounts, manipulate financial transactions, siphon customer payment information, divert funds, or enact other fraudulent activities.

Execution: 

These phishing attacks are often delivered via emails, social media messages, or text messages (smishing) that mimic official communications from payment processors, e-commerce platforms, or financial institutions. Merchants are lured to counterfeit websites that resemble legitimate login pages where they are prompted to enter their account details. These spoofed sites capture the inputted credentials, which are then used by the fraudsters to access the merchant's actual account.

Examples:

An email sent to a merchant purporting to be from their payment processor, alerting them to a problem with their account and requesting they click on a provided link to resolve it. The link redirects to a fake login page designed to harvest credentials.
A message via social media from a fake account claiming to represent a marketplace platform, instructing the merchant to confirm their account information due to a security update, using a fraudulent website link.
Fraudulent text messages sent to merchants directing them to ""verify"" their account details to prevent their account from being suspended, using a phishing link disguised as an official website.

In this particular use case, attackers leverage compromised credentials or stolen credit cards to purchase ad space on social media platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram. They create advertisements for fraudulent merchant sites equipped with credit card skimming software or for legitimate merchants whose sites have been compromised with such software. The goal is to either capture the card details from direct purchases made on the fraudulent merchants' sites or by siphoning data from customers of the compromised legitimate merchants.

Execution: 

The execution involves setting up ad campaigns that lead unsuspecting users to malicious e-commerce sites or legitimate websites that have been injected with skimming code. The attackers design the ads to look genuine, often imitating real brands to increase their effectiveness. When a user follows an ad and makes a purchase, their credit card details are secretly harvested by the skimming software. In some cases, the user may not even receive the advertised product (the no-shipping aspect), furthering the profit of the fraudsters.

Examples:

Cybercriminals use stolen credit card data to fund large advertising campaigns on Facebook, directing users to sham e-commerce sites that capture payment data via skimming scripts.
Attackers compromise legitimate e-commerce websites, add skimming code, then buy ads that direct traffic to these sites, exploiting normal customer transactions for data theft.
Fraudulent merchants indirectly facilitate ad fraud by first acquiring user traffic through legitimate purchases, then transitioning to no-shipping practices, all while continuing to skim credit card information.


Goals: In engaging in ad fraud with skimming software, the attackers aim to:

FT019,,Website Cloning,"Website cloning is a technique whereby cybercriminals create a replica of a legitimate website with the intent to deceive visitors. The cloned website mimics the design, layout, and functionality of the original site, but is controlled by the attacker. Users are often directed to these fraudulent sites via phishing emails, social media links, or through search engine manipulation. Once on the cloned site, visitors may unknowingly provide sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, or personal details.

Execution: 

Attackers create a cloned website by copying the source code of the legitimate site and hosting it on a different server, often with a similar domain name designed to confuse potential victims (a practice known as ""typosquatting""). They might also inject malicious scripts into the cloned site for additional nefarious activities, such as capturing keystrokes or redirecting payments.

Examples:

An imposter copies a bank’s website to a domain that is off by one letter, hoping customers will not notice the URL difference and will enter their online banking credentials.

FT020,,Identity Theft for Merchant Accounts,"Identity theft for merchant account fraud occurs when bad actors use stolen personal information to set up merchant accounts on payment processing platforms. The fraudsters may use a victim’s name, address, social security number, or business information to create what appears to be a legitimate merchant account. Once the account is established, they can process fraudulent transactions or launder money through the account.

Execution: 

The process often begins with the theft of an individual's or a business's identifying information through methods like data breaches, phishing, or social engineering. With this information, the fraudster then applies for a merchant account, providing the stolen details as if they were their own. After the account is approved, they might process stolen credit card transactions, funnel ill-gotten gains through the account for laundering purposes, or engage in phony transactions designed to cheat credit card rewards or inflate business revenue figures artificially.

Examples:

FT022,,Churning,"Churning, in the context of financial fraud, refers to the process where fraudsters use stolen credit card details repeatedly to conduct transactions until the card's limit is reached or the account's balance is fully drained. This type of fraud is particularly damaging because it can swiftly accrue a significant financial loss for the cardholder before the unauthorized activity is detected and the card is disabled.

Execution: 

The fraudster typically begins with a small 'test' transaction to verify that the stolen card details are active and have not yet been reported. Once this initial transaction succeeds, they rapidly make as many transactions as possible. This often involves making purchases online where immediate verification is not required, or ""cashing out"" by purchasing gift cards, currency, or other easily liquidated items.

Examples:

A criminal gains access to stolen credit card information and starts by conducting a small transaction online to ensure the card is valid and functional. After the success of this low-value transaction, they make numerous high-value purchases in succession.
Using eCommerce platforms to purchase digital goods or services that do not require shipping and can be quickly resold for cash.
Buying prepaid debit cards, cryptocurrencies, or other financial instruments that can be immediately used or converted into funds.

Goals: The primary goals of conducting churning fraud include:

FT023,,Dispute Avoidance,"Dispute avoidance is a strategy employed by online merchants to proactively address issues that could lead to chargebacks or payment disputes. This strategy involves identifying potential disputes before they happen and resolving the underlying issues to the customer’s satisfaction. Merchants may issue refunds, provide credits, replace products, or offer other forms of compensation to dissuade customers from filing a formal dispute with their bank or credit card provider.

Execution: 

Merchants may use a variety of data points to identify transactions at higher risk of resulting in a dispute. These may include customer complaints, unusual purchasing patterns, or signals from tools designed to flag potentially problematic transactions. They may also look for patterns of behavior associated with genuine customer dissatisfaction or fraud, such as multiple payment attempts or transactions that fail address verification checks.

Examples:

A customer support system flags a delivery as late, and the merchant proactively contacts the customer, offering a discount or refund before the customer initiates a dispute.
AI-powered analytics tools like ""disputifier"" review patterns in customer interactions and suggest issuing refunds or replacement orders to customers showing signs of possible dispute initiation.
Monitoring social media and online forums for any negative feedback about products or services to quickly engage with dissatisfied customers and mitigate any issues.

Goals: The goals of dispute avoidance are to:

FT024,,Fabricating shipping evidence,"Fabricating shipping evidence is a fraudulent tactic used by dishonest sellers to deceive customers and dispute resolution services. In this scam, the seller provides false proof that an item was shipped to the customer, typically by utilizing authentic tracking numbers from unrelated shipments. The tracking numbers are often sourced from the same geographic location and approximate time frame as the delivery address of the legitimate customer to add credibility to the claim that the item was shipped and delivered.

Execution: 

The fraudsters acquire valid tracking numbers, which could be from their own previous legitimate shipments or from pilfered information through insider access at shipping companies, online forums, or by using tracking number generators. They then attribute these tracking numbers to shipments for transactions where no actual item is sent to the customers. When customers claim non-receipt and initiate a dispute, the seller presents the unrelated but valid tracking information as evidence of delivery to dispute resolution systems employed by platforms like eBay, Amazon, or payment processing services.

Examples:

A seller lists an item for sale online and collects payment but never sends the product. When the customer opens a dispute, the seller submits a valid tracking number from a different package that was delivered around the same time to the same ZIP code.
Acquiring bulk tracking numbers from shipments that were delivered within the customer's region and systematically assigning them to fraudulent transactions to assert items were delivered.
Manipulating online shipping tools or services to generate tracking information that appears legitimate to resolve disputes in the seller’s favor.

Goals: The primary goals behind fabricating shipping evidence are to:

Win disputes against claims of non-delivery by providing seemingly valid proof to the payment processor or platform dispute resolution center.

FT025,,Fake Review Fraud,"Fake review fraud involves the posting of false or misleading product or service reviews online. Sellers commit this deception to artificially inflate the reputation and perceived quality of their offerings, thereby attracting more customers. This type of fraud can also direct consumers toward phishing sites or fraudulent payment links by disguising them as positive reviews with high customer satisfaction.

Execution: 

Fraudulent sellers or third-party services may generate fake reviews themselves or pay for such reviews to be posted. These reviews typically appear on e-commerce platforms, social media, review websites, and other online marketplaces. They're often crafted to appear genuine, complete with fabricated personal narratives and photos, sometimes even using automated ‘review bots’ to produce them en masse.

Examples:

A seller hires a firm that specializes in reputation management to flood their product pages with positive reviews, overshadowing any genuine negative feedback.
Positive reviews are posted along with fraudulent links claiming to offer discounts or additional information, which instead lead to phishing sites.
Sellers cross-post the same set of fabricated positive reviews across different products or platforms to bolster a wider range of offerings.

Upon identifying a compromised gateway, these teams work to close security gaps, assist affected users, and track stolen funds. Post-incident reviews help in tightening security postures and may include recommendations for rearchitecture or platform enhancement to prevent future breaches.",,FALSE,,,,,,,,,
FT032,,Credit Card Skimming,"Credit card skimming in the cyber domain refers to the unauthorized capture of credit card information by inserting malicious code into the front-end of e-commerce websites, known as digital skimming or e-skimming. This can happen through compromised third-party scripts or direct attacks on the website. The stolen credit card data — often including card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes — is then transmitted to servers under the control of cybercriminals.

Execution: Attackers typically execute credit card skimming by injecting malicious JavaScript code into payment pages on e-commerce sites, often by exploiting vulnerabilities in the site itself or in third-party services integrated with the site. This code runs in the user’s browser when they enter their payment details and surreptitiously sends a copy of the data to a server controlled by the attackers.

Examples:

Infiltrating a website through outdated plugins or insecure admin credentials and adding skimming code to the website's payment form processing scripts.
Compromising widely used third-party scripts, such as those for customer service chatboxes, analytics tools, or ad networks, and using them to inject the skimming code on multiple websites simultaneously.
Creating entire phishing websites that resemble legitimate e-commerce platforms designed to harvest credit card information from unsuspecting victims.

Goals: The goals of attackers engaging in credit card skimming are to:

Collect as much credit card data as possible from unsuspecting victims for unauthorized purchases, fraudulent transactions, or sale on the dark web.
Carry out the attacks while remaining undetected for as long as possible to maximize the amount of data collected.
Undermine the security and trust in e-commerce platforms and potentially exploit the stolen data for subsequent identity theft or social engineering attacks.",,1/30/24,1/30/24,ft3,V.1,Manipulation & Fraudulent Transactions,"Regularly scanning websites for unauthorized changes or anomalous script behavior that might indicate the presence of skimming code.

Regularly updating and patching all website components, including content management systems and plugins, to reduce vulnerability to script injections.

Educating customers on the importance of monitoring their credit card statements for unauthorized charges, which could indicate card skimming has occurred.

Use by Fraud Detection and Analysis Teams: 

Fraud detection teams should have specialized tools to detect patterns and signals indicative of credit card skimming. These might include unexpected network requests from payment pages, reports of fraudulent charges from customers, or detection of known skimming scripts. In the event of a skimming attack detection, immediate action is required to remove the offending code, assess the scope of the data breach, issue warnings to potentially affected customers, and implement additional security measures to prevent future attacks. Working with cybersecurity forensics teams can help in understanding the attacker's methods and aiding law enforcement efforts to track down the perpetrators.",,FALSE,,,,,,,,,
FT032.001,,Credit Card Skimming: Malicious Javascript Skimming,"Malicious JavaScript skimming is a specific form of digital credit card theft where attackers inject unauthorized JavaScript code into the webpages of e-commerce sites. This covert script typically targets the payment information entered by customers during the checkout process. When a user submits their payment details, the skimmer script intercepts the information and transmits it to a server under the attacker’s control.

Execution: 

Hackers may infect websites with skimming JavaScript in several ways, such as exploiting security vulnerabilities to directly alter website files, compromising third-party scripts that are included on payment pages, tricking website administrators into installing malicious updates, or through phishing attacks that grant attackers access to the site's content management system. The malicious code is often obfuscated to evade detection by obscuring its purpose and intent.

Examples:

An attacker modifies an e-commerce website's payment page JavaScript files to include a skimming script, which collects payment card data when customers make a purchase.
Hackers compromise a widely used third-party JavaScript library (like a chat support tool or analytics tracker), inserting skimming code that affects all websites that load the library.
Cybercriminals conduct spear-phishing campaigns targeting site administrators, stealing their credentials, and gaining access to the backend of e-commerce platforms to plant skimmer scripts.

Goals: The objectives of attackers using malicious JavaScript skimming are typically to:

Stealthily harvest payment card details (card numbers, expiration dates, and CVVs) from a large number of unsuspecting e-commerce customers.
Collect and sell stolen credit card information on the dark web or use it to perform fraudulent transactions.
Maintain persistence on compromised websites and continue to collect data over extended periods without being detected.",,1/30/24,1/30/24,ft3,V.1,Manipulation & Fraudulent Transactions,"Regularly scanning websites, particularly payment forms, for unauthorized or modified scripts.

FT033,,No Shipping,"The ""No Shipping"" technique in the context of online fraud refers to scenarios where fraudsters manipulate e-commerce transactions to bypass the requirement for a shipping address, often in digital goods purchases or when using stolen credit card information. Since shipping addresses can be used to verify the purchaser’s identity and physical location, avoiding the need to provide a legitimate address can reduce the risk of detection and increase the success of fraudulent transactions.

Execution: 

Attackers target online storefronts that do not mandate a shipping address for certain types of purchases, particularly for digital products or services such as gift cards, software licenses, subscriptions, or other downloadable content. When using stolen credit card information, fraudsters prefer these types of transactions as they receive the goods directly and anonymously without the need for delivery to a physical location.

Examples:

A fraudster purchases online gift cards or digital content using stolen credit card details, where the items are delivered via email or directly accessible through an online account, with no physical shipping required.
An attacker exploits a website's checkout process that allows opting out of shipping details for certain products, even though a physical product might be involved, to avoid creating a delivery address trail that could be traced.
Manipulating e-commerce platforms that have insufficient checks for digital purchases, allowing the immediate issuance of redeemable assets without confirming the authenticity of the purchaser’s details.

Goals: The primary goal for a cybercriminal using the ""No Shipping"" technique is to:

Evade additional validation checks that may come with providing a physical shipping address, thus reducing the risk of being caught.
Quickly realize the value from stolen credit card information by immediately obtaining usable goods or services that can be resold or converted to cash.
Prevent linking back to their physical location, which can be important for maintaining anonymity and avoiding law enforcement pursuit.

Enforcing the entry of verified billing addresses even for digital purchases and matching them against the card details provided (AVS - Address Verification System).

Setting up limits for the purchase amounts or quantities for digital goods to minimize exposure to fraudulent bulk buys.

Use by Fraud Detection and Analysis Teams: 

Fraud detection teams need to stay alert to the ""No Shipping"" method of fraud, especially for businesses offering digital products. This requires setting up alerts for suspicious or anomalous purchase patterns and deploying machine learning models trained to detect the subtle signs of fraud commonly associated with digital transactions. Continuous monitoring, coupled with layered security measures like two-factor authentication for purchases, can deter fraudsters and protect both the business and legitimate customers. An immediate response protocol should be in place to address suspected fraudulent activities, secure any exposed customer data, and limit financial loss.",,FALSE,,,,,,,,,
FT033.001,,No Shipping: Non-Delivery of Goods,"The ""Non-Delivery of Goods (No Shipping)"" technique is a form of online retail fraud in which fraudsters establish merchant accounts—often on well-known e-commerce platforms—and list products for sale without any intention of providing the goods to purchasers. Merchants choose price points (typically in the $10-$50 range) that are low enough to deter buyers from pursuing disputes, thereby reducing the likelihood of chargebacks that can trigger an investigation by the e-commerce platform or payment processing partner such as Stripe.

Execution: 

Fraudsters proceed by creating seemingly legitimate online storefronts, complete with product catalogs that often feature popular or in-demand items priced attractively to draw in consumers. They carefully manage customer communications to maintain the illusion of legitimacy for as long as possible, delaying the discovery of the scam. They may provide fake tracking numbers or falsely claim that items are backordered. By the time buyers realize they won't receive their orders, the fraudsters may have already withdrawn the proceeds and shut down their operation.

Examples:

Setting up an online shop offering a variety of items, often with stolen or fake product images and descriptions, while pricing the items to make charge disputes less appealing for customers.
Creating fraudulent listings on marketplace platforms or auction sites and taking advantage of the platform's pre-existing traffic and credibility.
Using social media advertising to direct potential buyers to the fraudulent e-commerce setup.

Goals: The goals behind this ""Non-Delivery of Goods (No Shipping)"" technique typically include:

Profiting from the sale of non-existent goods while minimizing the risk of getting caught by choosing a low-cost product that buyers might write off as a bad purchase rather than actively pursue a refund or report.
Exploiting consumer trust in e-commerce platforms and payment systems to quickly accumulate a large number of small transactions before the scam is detected.
Avoiding the logistics and cost associated with shipping counterfeit goods or dealing with inventory.
",,1/30/24,1/30/24,ft3,V.1,Manipulation & Fraudulent Transactions,"Implementing advanced fraud detection algorithms that flag merchants with unusual patterns of sales without corresponding shipping activity.

Monitoring for a high volume of small transactions by new merchant accounts as potential red flags for this type of fraud.

Instituting more rigorous identity and background checks for new merchant accounts, particularly those on e-commerce platforms.

Encouraging customers to report instances of non-delivery and pursuing these cases proactively.

Enabling customers to provide ratings and reviews of sellers and paying attention to repeated negative feedback related to non-delivery.

Use by Fraud Detection and Analysis Teams: 

Fraud detection teams should scrutinize merchant accounts for behaviors that suggest the non-delivery of goods, such as patterns of customer complaints, lack of shipping verification, and rapid increases in transaction volumes for new sellers. Anomalies should be met with swift investigation, potentially freezing the merchants' funds and accounts while the issues are resolved. Affected customers should be informed about the potential fraud and guided through the refund or chargeback process if necessary. Continuous analysis of transaction data across the platform can help identify common characteristics of fraudulent merchant behavior, enabling the refinement of detection mechanisms and preventative measures.",,TRUE,FT033,,,,,,,,
FT033.002,,No Shipping: Partial Shipping of Goods,"""Partial Shipping of Goods"" is a strategy used by fraudulent sellers who fulfill only a portion of customer orders, creating a facade of legitimacy to deceive both consumers and fraud detection systems. By selectively shipping some goods, sellers manipulate the perception of their business, making it appear as though they are operating legitimately while they strategically default on other orders. It prolongs the interval before suspicions arise and complaints are filed, allowing fraudsters to continue their deceptive actions and potentially reap more profits before being detected.

Execution: 

Fraudsters employing the partial shipping tactic usually set up online storefronts, resembling legitimate businesses, where they offer products that may or may not exist. After receiving orders, they fulfill just enough of them to establish a record of deliveries and to seed positive feedback. This selective fulfillment lends credibility to their operation when in reality, a significant proportion of customers may never receive their items. Fraudulent sellers might also use this tactic when they hit supply chain issues, deliberately choosing which orders to fulfill based on factors such as customer location, item value, or likelihood of chargeback disputes.

Examples:

A fraudulent e-commerce site sells a range of products and fulfills low-value orders while neglecting high-value ones, banking on customers to forgo pursuing refunds for the cheaper items.
An online seller on a marketplace platform ships goods to customers who are most likely to leave reviews or provide feedback, ignoring or delaying shipments to other buyers.
A fraudulent merchant fulfills initial orders to build a trustworthy seller profile, then starts accepting a large number of orders with no intention of shipping them all.

Goals: The objectives of fraudsters partially shipping goods are to:

Maximize the amount of money made from sales before being flagged by customers or the platform's fraud detection mechanisms.
Stretch out the time before a critical mass of complaints triggers an investigation by the e-commerce platform or payment processor.
Construct a veneer of trust and reliability by ensuring some positive customer experiences.",,1/30/24,1/30/24,ft3,V.1,Manipulation & Fraudulent Transactions,"Implementing system checks that flag discrepancies between the number of orders received and the number of shipments confirmed.

Monitoring seller performance metrics, including delivery rates and customer feedback patterns for signs of inconsistency.

Allowing customers a platform to report issues with sellers, and taking customer complaints seriously especially when there's a pattern of non-delivery reports.

Instituting policies that hold payments in escrow until customers confirm the receipt of goods.

Performing random spot-checks or quality assurance assessments of sellers known to operate at the margins of acceptable delivery performance.

Use by Fraud Detection and Analysis Teams: 

Fraud detection teams should be alert to patterns indicative of partial shipping practices, such as consistent negative feedback for non-delivery, while some customers report successful transactions. Analysis of customer complaints, shipping logs, and order fulfillment data should be conducted to identify and confirm fraudulent behavior. Upon detection of partial shipping fraud, immediate measures can be taken to suspend the merchant's operations, conduct a thorough review of their activities, and take remedial actions to protect consumers and recover funds. It is critical for teams to work swiftly as such sellers may quickly move on to set up new fraudulent operations under different identities after being discovered.",,TRUE,FT033,,,,,,,,
FT033.003,,No Shipping: Shipping of Incorrect Goods,"""No Shipping: Shipping of Incorrect Goods"" is a fraudulent technique employed by unscrupulous sellers who deliberately ship items that are different from what was promised or entirely incorrect in nature. This strategy is designed to mislead customers and exploit their reliance on received goods, taking advantage of their frustration or confusion to reduce the likelihood of returns or disputes. By delivering incorrect items, fraudsters aim to prolong their fraudulent operations and evade detection longer, as customers may either accept the incorrect item or be dissuaded from pursuing refunds due to the complexity of the return process.

Fraudsters utilizing the no shipping technique often create enticing online listings featuring desirable products at low prices. Once orders are received, they ship completely different items—such as lower-quality alternatives or unrelated products. This tactic exploits the expectations of consumers, banking on the hope that buyers will be deterred from returning incorrect items due to effort involved or may even keep them out of frustration. In some cases, the fraudulent seller may send an item of minimal value but one that is misleadingly similar to the original order to further obscure their deception.

A fraudulent online retailer advertises high-end electronics but ships cheap knock-off versions to customers, banking on their reluctance to return low-value items. An e-commerce seller markets trendy fashion items but delivers entirely different clothing that lacks branding or quality, knowing that many consumers may simply choose to keep the items rather than deal with the hassle of returns. A merchant on a marketplace platform claims to sell popular gift items but often sends random, unrelated products, taking advantage of busy holiday shoppers who may not pursue refunds due to time constraints.

Maximize profit by exploiting customer expectations and minimizing returns or chargeback disputes. Extend the operational life of fraudulent activities by confusing customers and reducing the likelihood of complaints. Create a veneer of legitimacy by occasionally shipping slight variations of the ordered products, further obscuring fraudulent intent.",,2/2/25,1/30/24,ft3,V.1,Manipulation & Fraudulent Transactions,,,,,,,,,,,,
FT033.004,,No Shipping: Fabricating shipping evidence,"""No Shipping: Fabricating Shipping Evidence"" is a deceptive technique used by fraudsters to create false proof of shipment in order to mislead customers and payment processors about the status of an order. By generating falsified tracking numbers, invoices, or shipment confirmations, these fraudsters create the appearance that an order has been shipped, even when no actual items have been dispatched. This technique is often employed to delay refunds and buy time, allowing fraudsters to continue their operations undetected while customers remain unaware that they have been defrauded.

Fraudsters leveraging the fabricating shipping evidence technique typically set up online stores or market listings where they receive payments for goods they never intend to deliver. Once an order is placed, they create fake shipping labels and tracking information using online tools, sending these details to customers in an attempt to convince them that their purchases are on the way. This tactic can exploit the trust customers place in shipping confirmation emails and tracking services, reinforcing the fraudster’s deception and complicating potential chargebacks or disputes.

Examples of this technique include: A fraudulent seller generates fake tracking numbers that show 'in transit' status to deflect inquiries from customers, despite having never shipped any products. An online store sends automated messages containing fabricated shipping confirmations to customers, communicating false delivery timelines and misdirecting them from seeking refunds. A marketplace seller deliberately delays notifying customers of order cancellations, instead providing them with spurious tracking information to extend the time before complaints arise.

The goals of fraudsters fabricating shipping evidence include: Easing pressure from customers by giving the illusion that their orders are fulfilled, thereby reducing the likelihood of refunds or disputes. Buying time to either continue fraudulent operations or shut down and flee when detection is imminent. Creating a facade of legitimacy and professionalism by mimicking standard shipping practices, leading customers to feel more at ease with their transactions.""",,1/30/24,1/30/24,ft3,V.1,Manipulation & Fraudulent Transactions,,,,,,,,,,,,
FT034,,Triangulation Fraud,"Triangulation fraud is a sophisticated type of e-commerce scam involving three parties: the unsuspecting customer, the fraudulent storefront, and the legitimate retailer. In this scheme, fraudsters set up online storefronts that appear genuine and offer products—typically high-demand or heavily discounted items—to lure in customers. However, instead of fulfilling orders from their own stock, the fraudsters use stolen credit card information to purchase the goods from legitimate retailers and ship them directly to the customers who made the purchase.

Execution: 

The process begins when a customer orders and pays for a product on the fraudulent storefront. The fraudster then turns around and orders the same item from a legitimate retailer using a different, stolen credit card and has it shipped to the customer's address. Unaware of the fraud, the customer receives the item they ordered, but the legitimate credit card owner ends up being charged. The fraudster profits from the original payment made by the customer to the phony storefront and may also harvest the customer’s payment information for future fraudulent activities.

Examples:

A scammer creates an online shop offering the latest electronic gadgets at unbeatable prices. When customers place orders, the scammer uses compromised credit card data to order the gadgets from legitimate e-commerce sites and ships them to the customers.
During a popular shopping season, a fraudulent website advertises hard-to-find toys. Unsuspecting shoppers order the toys, and the fraudster fulfills the orders with goods purchased illegally from legitimate vendors.

Goals: The goals of triangulation fraud include:

Illegitimately profiting from the difference in price between what the customer pays and the cost of purchasing the item with a stolen credit card.
Gaining valid customer credentials, including names, addresses, and payment information, for future fraudulent transactions.
Avoiding immediate detection by delivering the product to the customer, thereby reducing the likelihood of early complaints to law enforcement or financial institutions.",,1/30/24,1/30/24,ft3,V.1,Manipulation & Fraudulent Transactions,"Monitoring for unusual purchasing patterns on e-commerce platforms, such as multiple purchases destined for various addresses but charged to the same card or accounts with high order volumes but using different payment methods.

Verifying the authenticity of new online retailers offering in-demand items at below-market prices and checking for customer reviews or a history of prior transactions.

Educating consumers on the risks of entering payment information on unverified websites, especially those recently established or offering deals that seem too good to be true.

Retailers should implement additional fraud checks for orders that have different billing and shipping details, particularly when multiple orders match this pattern.

Use by Fraud Detection and Analysis Teams: Fraud detection teams at financial institutions and e-commerce platforms should monitor for patterns indicative of triangulation fraud, such as chargebacks associated with recently delivered orders or clusters of complaints from cardholders about charges from retailers they haven't patronized. Active collaboration between retailers, payment processors, and card issuers is necessary to quickly identify and respond to triangulation scams. Upon suspecting triangulation fraud, teams should take immediate steps, such as blocking transaction processing for suspicious storefronts, alerting potential victims, initiating chargebacks, and, where possible, intercepting deliveries to prevent the receipt of fraudulently-purchased goods.",,FALSE,,,,,,,,,
FT035,,Dispute Avoidance,"Dispute Avoidance is a strategy typically employed by businesses to prevent potential disputes and chargebacks that may be raised by customers. This proactive approach involves addressing customer issues and refunding payments before the customer escalates them to formal disputes with their bank or credit card issuer. Advanced AI tools like ""disputifier"" analyze communication and transaction patterns to predict and preemptively address disputes by issuing refunds or engaging in proactive customer service interactions.

Execution: 

Businesses, particularly online merchants, closely monitor customer interactions, complaints, and other signs that could indicate dissatisfaction with a purchase. Using AI and machine learning algorithms, these merchants can analyze indicators such as the sentiment in customer emails, frequency of customer support inquiries, or the nature of the purchase to identify transactions where a dispute or chargeback is likely to occur. They can then reach out to the customer to offer refunds, discounts on future purchases, or other incentives to resolve the issue amicably.

Examples:

An e-commerce merchant automatically issuing refunds to customers who send emails indicating strong dissatisfaction or intent to return an item.
Using disputifier or similar AI tools to analyze customer support tickets, identifying trends and specific language cues that are statistically linked to high rates of disputes and proactively resolving these issues.
A subscription service provider preemptively offering partial refunds or account credits to subscribers who have experienced service disruptions or who frequently contact customer support with issues.

Goals: The main goals behind dispute avoidance practices are to:

Reduce the number and cost of chargebacks and disputes which may involve additional fees, administrative costs, and potential loss of goods or services.
Maintain and enhance the merchant's reputation by demonstrating a customer-centric approach to service and issue resolution.
Preserve the relationship with the customer by turning a potential negative experience into a positive one, fostering loyalty and repeat business.

Fraud detection teams can collaborate with customer service departments to leverage AI tools that identify and respond to potential disputes. By monitoring patterns of transactions that later result in chargebacks, teams can refine machine learning models to become more accurate in predicting and preventing future disputes. Ongoing analysis of the effectiveness of proactive refunds and other dispute avoidance strategies can inform best practices and policy adjustments, helping to strike a balance between excellent customer service and the overall financial health of the business.",,FALSE,,,,,,,,,
FT036,,Refund Fraud,"Refund fraud is a deceptive practice where customers exploit a merchant's return policy to obtain a refund through false pretenses. They make legitimate purchases but then falsely claim that the products were never delivered, defective, not as described, or they may return a different or altered item. This fraud can also involve the unauthorized use of someone else’s purchase information to initiate a refund to a different payment method.

Execution: There are several methods of executing refund fraud, including:

""Item not received"" (INR): The customer claims the item was not delivered, despite delivery confirmation.
""Significantly not as described"" (SNAD): The customer alleges the item received is vastly different from the item advertised.
""Return item fraud"": The customer returns an item that is different or in worse condition than what was initially purchased.
""Friendly fraud"": The customer makes a purchase with their own credit card, receives the product, and then issues a chargeback or refund request with their bank under false claims.

Examples:

After ordering an item online and receiving it, the customer falsely claims the product never arrived and demands a refund or replacement.
A customer returns a purchased electronic device after swapping out its components with older or non-functioning ones, leaving the merchant with a defective return.
Purchasing high-value items, using them for an event or purpose, and then returning them despite the items being non-defective.
Reporting a legitimate purchase as an unauthorized transaction to their credit card company to recover the amount spent while retaining the products.

Goals: The goal for customers committing refund fraud is to receive a product or service without ultimately paying for it, or even to profit by selling the merchandise while also reclaiming the purchase price. They may also seek to exploit return policies for longer-term use of items without purchase commitment.",,1/30/24,1/30/24,ft3,V.1,Manipulation & Fraudulent Transactions,"Employing stringent return and refund verification procedures, including inspection of returned items and cross-referencing return reasons with customer service records.

This can include changing contact details, manipulating account settings, adding or editing payout schedules and linked bank accounts, or creating unauthorized new user accounts with broad access permissions.

Execution: 

Typically, account manipulation begins once an attacker gains access to a Stripe account through phishing, credential stuffing, social engineering, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once inside the account, the attacker makes subtle changes that may not immediately alert the account owner. This could involve updating email addresses to intercept notifications and confirmations, changing payout information to divert funds, and modifying security settings to weaken the account's defenses against future unauthorized access.

Examples:

Changing the email associated with a Stripe account to one controlled by the attacker, thereby receiving all communications and furthering control.
Modifying the linked bank account details so that all future payouts are transferred to an account the attacker owns.
Adjusting security settings, for example, by disabling two-factor authentication, making the account more vulnerable to future attacks or easing the takeover process.
Goals: The objectives of manipulative activities on a Stripe account include:

Diverting funds from legitimate business operations into bank accounts controlled by the attacker.

FT037.001,,Account Manipulation: Additional User Account,"Account manipulation involving the addition of an extra user to a compromised Stripe account is a strategic move that falls under the category of 'command and control' tactics used by cybercriminals. Once an attacker has gained access to a Stripe account, they can abuse the platform's features to add new, unauthorized users. This allows them not only to maintain control over the compromised account but also to establish additional avenues to facilitate illicit activities without raising immediate suspicion.

Execution: 

In the execution of this tactic, an attacker with initial access to a Stripe account uses their level of infiltration to inject a new user with permissions set to levels that enable data access and perhaps transaction capabilities. This is often done stealthily, with contact information that goes overlooked or masquerades as legitimate business contacts. The new user account could be disguised to appear as a legitimate team member, temporary consultant, or a third-party service provider.

Examples:

An attacker, after compromising a merchant's Stripe account credentials, stealthily adds a new user with administrative privileges, effectively setting up a backdoor for uninterrupted access and transaction control.
Fraudulently adding a fake ""audit"" or ""tech support"" account under the guise of performing a routine check or system update, allowing for continued oversight and control by the attacker.
The cybercriminal creates multiple user profiles with different access levels to segment their activities and evade detection by spreading out unauthorized actions across these profiles.

Goals: The primary objectives behind adding unauthorized user accounts to a compromised Stripe account are to:

Maintain persistent access to the Stripe account, even if the original breach is discovered and closed.
Manage fraudulent transactions, such as initiating payouts, refunds, or modifying payment flows, through secondary user accounts to complicate tracing efforts.

By designing counterfeit payment portals that resemble well-known payment processors, fraudsters can deceive consumers into entering sensitive financial information, including credit card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes. This information is then captured by the fraudsters, who can use it for unauthorized transactions or sell it on the dark web, leading to significant financial losses for victims.

Criminals employing this technique often place fake payment gateways on phishing websites, where unsuspecting consumers are tricked into completing transactions that they believe are secure. These fraudulent sites may use familiar branding and user interfaces to mask their illegitimacy, often pulling in victims who assume they are dealing with a reputable service. Once victims input their payment details, the fake gateway may then redirect them to a legitimate site or a thank-you page, reinforcing the illusion that their transaction was successful.

Examples of this technique include: A phishing site that looks identical to a popular e-commerce platform prompts users to enter their payment information, capturing the details before redirecting them to the real site as if nothing was amiss. A fake charity website uses a counterfeit payment processor to solicit donations, collecting card information from well-meaning individuals who believe they are supporting a genuine cause. A fraudulent online service disguises its payment form as a known payment gateway, tricking users into submitting their credit card information under the guise of necessary subscription fees.

The goals of those utilizing fake payment gateways are: To collect sensitive payment information quickly and efficiently for immediate use in unauthorized transactions. To establish a façade of legitimacy that reassures victims, reducing their suspicion and increasing the likelihood of data input. To execute the fraudulent scheme in a manner that makes it challenging for victims to trace their transactions or recover stolen funds, maximizing the fraudster's profit before discovery and apprehension.",,3/4/25,3/4/25,ft3,V.1,Defense Evasion & Obfuscation,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,
